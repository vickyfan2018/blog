<h1>Iterations</h1>

<br>
<h2>Failure in Scribble animation on scroll</h2>

<h3>Not able to run it in Safari</h3>
<p>Although I successfully added the scribble animation in the homepage on desktop version, but I found that the effect is not displayed in mobile version. The above photo is the photo of failure in loading the animation in Safari. </p>
<br>
<h2> Not stable loading in Android</h2>
<p>Andriod sometimes can load the effect</p>

But sometimes, it cannot. </p>
<br>
<img src="https://vickyfan2018.github.io/blog/assets/browser.jpg">
<p>I found out that it is because the main core of the effect, attributed by the mix-blend-mode CSS, is not supported in safari and mobile android platform. Therefore, I deleted the entire effect</p>

<br>

<h2>Still trying to do the scribble effect</h2>

<h3>Using animation and png sprike</h3>
<p>I am trying to use an ink sprike to do the animated scribble effect. </p>

<p>This is the ink sprike png I am using to to create the effect.</p>

<p> However, after the effect was run, there was a grey spot on the sketch. </p>
<br>
<p>Therefore, I am still figuring out how to do this effect.</p>

<br>

<h2>User testing </h2>
<h3>User interviews</h3>
<p>I conducted user interviews with 5 users (in Cantonese) to improve my website. Here is the questions.</p>
<li>
	<ul>How do you feel about the website?</ul>
	<ul>What do you think about the index page?</ul>
	<ul>How do you feel about the progress in accessing the product page?</ul>
	<ul>How do you feel about the flow of the website?</ul>
</li>

<p>As the transcript of the interviews is in Chinese, I am not going to post and rewrite the transcript in English, but after the user interviews, I found several main comments.</p>

<li>
	<ol> The website is really easy to navigate. Users can go to the product page easily.</ol>
	<ol> The website creates a vintage mood and successfully conveys the story of a shop with long history.</ol>
	<ol> The video on the index page attracts users' attention.</ol>
</li>

<h3>User testing - observation </h3>
	<p>I tried to do live observation when users accessing the webpage. Thus, I asked 5 users to go to the site, and I observed their activities on mouseflow.com.
	<p>I found that when doing user testing all of the users sucessfully went into the product page and they accessed to the highlighted and the most expensive products, which were good. However, I found how they use the website is different from people who use the website remotely. Because they knew that I was watching them using the website when they navigated the website, they tried to click and scroll more. However, without telling users I was watching them using the site, they didn't scroll and click as frequent in observations. Hence, I used remote user testing instead. </p>

<h3> Remote user testing</h3>
<h4>Relooping the video</h4>
	<img src="https://vickyfan2018.github.io/blog/assets/heatmap-index.jpg">
	<p> Some classmates suggested me to delete the reloop button and make the video relooping by itself. However, I found that half of the users have clicked this button. I'm still thinking about if I should delete the button.
		
<h4>Navigation bar </h4>
	<p> I found that users tend to click the about us button on navigation bar, rather than the more button in the about us section in the index</p>

	<h4>Scrolling percentage</h4>
	<img src="https://vickyfan2018.github.io/blog/assets/heatmap.jpg">
	<p> I found that users only scroll through 50% to 70% of the pages. Especially, in the index page, they only scrolled to the middle of the page, which means that they only saw the top of the page and product highlighted section. Hence, this means that the about us section is ignored, so this section in the index is quite useless. </p>
