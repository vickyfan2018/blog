<h3>Responsive logo</h3>
<img src="https://vickyfan2018.github.io/blog/assets/sketch-1.jpg">
<p>I designed the original logo two years ago. Although I do not like this logo now, it has registered in the government already, so I still need to use this logo. When designing this logo two years ago, I did not design it with web application in mind, so I tried to simplify the logo to make it suitable being displayed on web.</p>

<h3>Moodboard and branding elements</h3>
<img src="https://vickyfan2018.github.io/blog/assets/ck-moodboard.jgg">
<p> As Chun Kee do not have any branding elements, I need to remake every visual elements showcasing the brand images, so I made a moodboard first.</p>
<img src="https://vickyfan2018.github.io/blog/assets/brand elements.png">
 <p> As Chun Kee is a traditional Chinese brand, which still used bamboo steamers, so the color patlette is brownish with some red tone, showcasing that it is a vintage Chinese noodle shop. To show the original and vintage images of Chun Kee, hand-drawn illustrations showing different noodle and imprinted typefaces are used.</p>


<h3>Mockup screens for the website</h3>
<h4>Mobile</h4>
	<p>As the users of the site will use mobile site the most, so the design is mobile first. Every elements will be expanded based on the design of the mobile site.</p> 
	<img src="https://vickyfan2018.github.io/blog/assets/prototype -2_Page_1.png">
	<p>The opening screen is straight forwards. People can get it is a noodle shop selling authentic Chinese noodle through the photograph of the products.</p>

	<li>He does not want to have an online store. Information of ingredients, cooking methods of noodle only.</li>
	<li>He wants to display English and Chinese on the webpages at the same time, as he can never find the translating button on a webpage.</li>
	<li>He wants the website be simple as most of the customers of the shop are middle-aged to old-aged, the website should be easily navigated. </li>
	</ul>
</li>

<br>

<ul>

<li>Gender: Female</li>

</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>
After doing these personas and interview, I think the website will be simple and easily be navigated as the target audiences are middle-aged people to the elderly. This website should be focusing on the historical images of the shop, as it is the significant point of Chun Kee.
