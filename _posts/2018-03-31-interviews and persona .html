<h3>Interview with the owner</h3>

<h4>About Chun Kee</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Chun Kee is one of the oldest Guangdong noodle factories in Hong Kong Island.</li>  
	<li>Compared to other noodle factories, Chun Kee is the only factory tha still uses traditional Chinese making methods. Many other factories have been transfered from the owners to other people who are without any noodle making knowledge. They use auto machines to make noodles now. Chun Kee still uses hand (with help of the machines) to make noodle.</li> 
	<li>Chun Kee Noodle Factory was commenced by Fan Chun in 1965, and has been inherited by him since Fan Chun passed away.</li> 
	<li>Chun Kee was originally located at 136 Sai Wan Ho and moved to 30 Hing Man St in 1975.</li> 
	</ul>
