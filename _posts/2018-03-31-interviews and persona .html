<h3>Interview with the owner</h3>

<h4>About Chun Kee</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Chun Kee is one of the oldest Guangdong noodle factories in Hong Kong Island.</li>  
	<li>Compared to other noodle factories, Chun Kee is the only factory tha still uses traditional Chinese making methods. Many other factories have been transfered from the owners to other people who are without any noodle making knowledge. They use auto machines to make noodles now. Chun Kee still uses hand (with help of the machines) to make noodle.</li> 
	<li>Chun Kee Noodle Factory was commenced by Fan Chun in 1965, and has been inherited by him since Fan Chun passed away.</li> 
	<li>Chun Kee was originally located at 136 Sai Wan Ho and moved to 30 Hing Man St in 1975.</li> 
	</ul>
<br>

<h4>Expectation of the website</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>showing the historical and vintage aspect of Chun Kee on the homepage, and the product pages can be more modern.</li> 
		<ul>
		<li>What are vintage and historical feelings to you?: old black and white photos </li> 
		</ul>
	 <li>He wants the website can display Chinese and English at the same time, which can show that Chun Kee is more internationalised now.</li>
	<li>Easy to use</li>
	<li>can be used on mobile phone</li>
	</ul>
<br>

<br>

<p>
After doing these personas and interview, I think the website will be simple and easily be navigated as the target audiences are middle-aged people to the elderly. This website should be focusing on the historical images of the shop, as it is the significant point of Chun Kee.
