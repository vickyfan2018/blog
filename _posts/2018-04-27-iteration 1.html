<h2>Favicon</h2>

<p>To make the website more professional, I added a favicon to the website</p>

<br>
<h2>Gif to mp4</h2>
<p>Although some classmates suggest that I could change the gif in the opening screen to a mp4 file, after I tested it with my user, the mp4 file could not be loaded in the mobile version, so I keep using the gif file </p>

<br>
<h2>Increasing space on the top of the "About Us" section</h2>
<img src="https://vickyfan2018.github.io/blog/assets/scroll-before.jpg">
<p>In the previous version, the top of the "Contact Us" section was cut after the user clicked the "Contact Us" on the navigation menu.</p>
<img src="https://vickyfan2018.github.io/blog/assets/scroll-code.jpg">
<p>Therefore, I added this snippet of code.</p>
<img src="https://vickyfan2018.github.io/blog/assets/onscroll.jpg">
<p>Hence, there is enough space between the top of the section and the text.</p>
<br>

<h2>Increasing the opacity of the text</h2>
<img src="https://vickyfan2018.github.io/blog/assets/media-before.jpg">
<p>Some users said it is hard to see the text in the half transparent black background.  </p>
<img src="https://vickyfan2018.github.io/blog/assets/media-code.jpg">
<p>Therefore, I deleted the black wrapper of the text, and added an overlay on the background image, so the opacity of the text would not be affected by the black background's opacity.  </p>
<img src="https://vickyfan2018.github.io/blog/assets/media-after.jpg">
<p>Hence, the text above the photos is more legible, and I also added text shadow to increase the legibility. </p>

<h2>Increasing the section height and font size</h2>
<p>As there are more users accessing the page by desktop, I increased the font size and the height of some sections, so that the text in each section will not be overlayed and the text is more legible in desktop version.</p>
