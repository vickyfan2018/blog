<p>To add more fun to use the website, I added a button animation, which when users click on the button, the white area will extend from the clicked area to the entire button background</p>

<h2>Scribble animation on scroll</h2>

<p>I added a scribble animation, which the sketches will be scribbled when the users scroll the page. When users scroll over the entire section, the whole sketches will be appeared. </p>

<p>In order to make the scribble effect, I added a svg polyline code exported from illustrator, overlaying on my sketches.  </p>

<p>In order to animate the effects when users scroll to the about us section, I used the MagicScroll and TweenMax js plungin to animate the svg line overlayed on the sketches. </p>
