<p>I tried to make a gif for the opening screen as I found that the mock up screen for the opening screen cannot convey vintage and authentic feelings, so I asked my uncle to send me videos to make a gif, aiming to convey the actual noodle making process.</p>

<h3>Difficulties</h3>
<h4>font file is too big</h4>

	<p>Originally, I wanted to use KhangXi as the heading typeface of Chinese text but the font file is 44MB, the browser failed to load it. I am going to compress the font file. If I cannot make it work, I would use another typeface</p>

	<p>Originally, I wanted to use the logo as the page pagination but I fail to use javascript to do that so I made an animated decoration next to each paragraph instead.</p>
