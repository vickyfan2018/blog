<h3>User testing and iterations</h3>

<p>After doing user testing, I found that people felt confused about if the photos and text on the products page are clickable. This is because on the index page, there are 'learn more' buttons after each paragraph. Hence, I added a 'learn more' button below each product.</p>

<br>
<p>Instead of using hamburger menu, I used text to show the menu button, as the elderly don't know what hamburger menu is. </p>

<p>I found that the users like to click the photos on the product details page, so I added a zooming effect on these photos. </p>

<p>I also found that the users like to click the text on the opening screen/gif, so I added a button after the tagline to attract people to go to the product page.  </p>

<h3>Difficultie solved</h3>
<h4>font file is too big</h4>

	<p>Although I tried to compress the Chinese font file in font squirrel, the file size is still too big, as there are 6000 commonly used characters in Chinese, so I used this software to take out the characters I am going to use to decrease the file size.</p>

<h3>Difficulties needed to be solved</h3>
<h4>Gif file is too big</h4>
	<img class="mobile-mockup" src="https://vickyfan2018.github.io/blog/assets/20-loop.gif">
	<p>After I showed the gif file to my uncle, he wanted to add one more scene, so I remade the gif, but the file size became very big. Even though I tried to compress the file to 20% of the original one, it still has 4.68MB. When I used my phone to open to website, it takes time to load the gif file.</p>
